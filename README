This is a set of source code and some scripts meant to examine costs of
C++ exception handling. The code was derived from the work made by
Patrice Roy (retrieved at 2015/10/11).

The initial intent was to make the tests repeatable on my machine. After
that, I made the tree sharable hoping that more participants can verify
the tests on more environments.

Requires:
  Cygwin <https://cygwin.com/>
    - make
    - g++
  Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 <https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx>

Usage:
  Run "make" from the top of the tree.
